# Contributing to j8a
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/gh/simonmittag/j8a), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/gh/simonmittag/j8a). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License](https://github.com/simonmittag/j8a/blob/master/LICENSE). Feel free to contact one of the project maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/simonmittag/j8a/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/simonmittag/j8a/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with necessary detail, background, and sample code
j8a is a proxy server. Filing bugs right now is simple and should include either mention of failing tests or sample http client.
